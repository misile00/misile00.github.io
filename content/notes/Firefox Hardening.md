## Overview

What is hardening? In real Firefox' world, **"hardening"** is just a synonym of **"customization"** related to privacy/security settings. With hardening, we aim to have a more private and safe internet experience. 

So, why are you doing this for Firefox, not for Chrome/Chromium? Because many browsers use Chromium engine, which lead to monopolization. I don't want to support this. In addition, with the configuration facilities Firefox offers to the user, it is much easier to increase privacy and anonymity. For these reasons, I prepared this document about Firefox.

### About document

I felt the need to divide this document to 4 groups: Level 1, Level 2, Level 3 and Level 4

* ***Level 1:*** Simple configurations. Easy to apply. Most sites will work normally. My suggestion for basic users.

* ***Level 2:*** Several advanced settings. It is relatively more difficult to do. Some sites may break. My suggestion for a little more knowledgeable users.

* ***Level 3:*** More advanced settings. It is not more difficult to complete. Sites are very likely to break. My suggestion for users who know what to do.

* ***Level 4:*** About how to use Arkenfox's user.js. Most sites will be broken. My suggestion for privacy and safety maniacs.


## Hardening

### Level 1

*Settings > Home > Browsing*
![[notes/images/firefox_hardening/browsing.png]]
Disable this two options.

*Settings > Home > Network > Setttings*
![[notes/images/firefox_hardening/network.png]]
![[notes/images/firefox_hardening/DoH.png]]Enable DNS over HTTPS.  Here you can select the DNS provider you want. I prefer Cloudflare for Families' Blocked Malware option. It is up to you whether or not to choose the DNS servers of a non -profit organization like Quad9.

*Settings > Home > Firefox Home Content*
![[notes/images/firefox_hardening/newtab.png]]
Disable this two option. 

*Settings > Search > Default Search Engine*
![[notes/images/firefox_hardening/search-engine.png]]
Here you can select any privacy-oriented search engine. Since the default options were DuckDuckGo, I chose it. If you want, you can add and choose a much more privacy-oriented service like SearX/SearXNG.

*Settings > Search > Search Suggestion*
![[notes/images/firefox_hardening/suggestions.png]]
Disable this option.

*Settings > Privacy & Security > Browser Privacy*
![[notes/images/firefox_hardening/ETP.png]]
Set this setting like that. Most websites don't have problems with this setting, but you can turn off Enhanced Tracking Protection for broken website.

![[notes/images/firefox_hardening/ETP_off.png]]
For turning off Enhanced Tracker Protection, click the shield icon to the left of the URL bar. And toggle the switch.

*Settings > Privacy & Security > Firefox Data Collection and Use*
![[notes/images/firefox_hardening/telemetry.png]]
Disable the telemetry.

*Settings > Privacy & Security > HTTPS-Only Mode*
![[notes/images/firefox_hardening/https_only.png]]
Select this option to enable HTTPS-Only Mode.
