### About Me

Hi, I'm AsÄ±m. I am interested in Linux, Cyber Security and Libre software. I love learning new things on these topics. I like to go deep into the computer systems. In general, my knowledge is on Linux system administration but I am also trying to learn new things about new technologies such as virtualization or cloud.
